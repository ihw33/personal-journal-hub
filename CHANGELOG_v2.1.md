# Changelog v2.1: Real AI Chatbot Implementation

**Date:** 2025-07-30

## üöÄ Overview

This update transitions the existing mockup chatbot system to a fully functional AI chatbot powered by the Gemini API. The primary goal was to enable the chatbot to understand and answer questions based on the 'Jeju 8-Week Course' content, providing users with a truly interactive and helpful experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend & Integration Development (Gemini CLI)

### 1. Gemini API Integration
- **Environment Setup**: Confirmed `GEMINI_API_KEY` was present in `.env.local`, ensuring the API key is securely managed.
- **Service Module**: Created a new dedicated service module at `src/services/geminiService.ts` to handle all communications with the Gemini API.
- **Library Installation**: Installed the `@google/generative-ai` npm package to facilitate API calls.

### 2. Chatbot Component Modification
- **Identified Core Component**: Analyzed the project structure and identified `src/components/course/IntegratedChatbot.tsx` as the core component for the live chatbot functionality.
- **Replaced Mock Logic**: The `sendMessage` function within `IntegratedChatbot.tsx` was completely overhauled. The previous `mockAIResponse` logic was removed.
- **Implemented Real API Call**: The chatbot now calls the `generateGeminiResponse` function from our new `geminiService.ts`.
- **Loading State**: The existing `isLoading` state is now effectively used to display a "AI is thinking..." message to the user while waiting for a response from the Gemini API.

### 3. Context-Aware Functionality (Key Feature)
- **Course Data Consolidation**: Systematically read and summarized the course content from `week1Data.ts` through `week8Data.ts`.
- **Context Injection**: Created `src/lib/courseContext.ts` to store a summarized string of the entire 8-week course.
- **Enhanced Prompts**: This course context is now prepended to every user question sent to the Gemini API. This ensures the AI has the necessary background information to provide relevant and accurate answers about the course content.

## ‚úÖ Final Result

The chatbot is no longer a mockup. It is a real, context-aware AI assistant capable of intelligently discussing the 'Jeju 8-Week Course' with users. This marks a significant milestone in making the platform truly interactive and valuable.
