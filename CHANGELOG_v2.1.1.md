# Changelog v2.1.1: Figma Source Synchronization & Test Feature Restoration

**Date:** 2025-07-30

## üöÄ Overview

This urgent update addresses a critical bug in the v2.1 deployment where role-based permissions were not functioning correctly, preventing access to course pages for authenticated users. The primary goal was to fully integrate the 'Test User Selection' panel from the Figma Make source code and ensure all six test user roles function as intended, establishing a stable baseline build.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend & Integration Development (Gemini CLI)

### 1. Test User Selection Panel Restoration
- **Component Creation**: Created `src/components/auth/TestUserSelectionModal.tsx` to provide a modal interface for selecting various test user roles.
- **App.tsx Integration**: Integrated the 'Test User Selection' button into `App.tsx`, ensuring it is always visible. The modal now correctly updates the `currentUser` state in `App.tsx` based on user selection.
- **Icon Fix**: Resolved a `ReferenceError: MinusCircle is not defined` by correctly importing `MinusCircle` from `lucide-react` in `TestUserSelectionModal.tsx`.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (Routing) Verification & Correction
- **Course Page Access**: Implemented robust access control for course-related pages (`course-dashboard`, `phase-learning`, `weekly-learning`, `trial-course`, `phase-submission`, `course-submission`, `course-feedback`).
- **Permission Logic**: Users with `guest` or `demo` roles are now correctly redirected to the `auth` page when attempting to access restricted course content.
- **Role Validation**: Ensured that `member`, `enrolled`, `instructor`, and `admin` roles have appropriate access to course content, aligning with the intended role-based permissions.

## ‚úÖ Final Result

The 'Test User Selection' panel is fully functional, allowing seamless switching between all six test user roles. Role-based access control for course pages has been verified and corrected, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific content. This establishes a stable and testable baseline build for future development.
